      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;begin-anecdote&#34;&gt;Begin anecdote&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I attempted to make a schedule today, which I felt very proud about. I started off by working on some SAT prep, then I did my social studies homework, and even started a physics assignment. That was the point at which everything derailed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I randomly found about about &lt;a href=&#34;https://hpmor.com&#34;&gt;Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a Harry Potter fanfic except that he&amp;rsquo;s raised by a scientist instead. I haven&amp;rsquo;t even read Harry Potter, and I loved it, which was problematic due to the fact that I was planning on being productive today. I read like 39 chapters of it today, and, in my defense, also worked on some more homework, but with &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; less efficiency and quality than normal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
