      <title>Removing comments from this site</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a few months having comments on this site, I have now decided to remove them. This is because my github account was temporarily suspended, probably because I kept reloading comments and having giscus load over and over. This broke a lot of stuff, including cloudflare, which couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to my github repo. Because of this, I have removed comment from my site until I find a new solution or can guarantee that I won&amp;rsquo;t manage to do this again sometime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adding comments to this site</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this blog for around one and a half years, and while it is true that I keep abandoning it for months at a time, I think I should still try to make it as good as possible. According to Cloudflare, I get around 70 unique visitors a day. I&amp;rsquo;m almost 100% certain that these are all bots, but there is a slim chance that some of you reading this are in fact human. Because of that, I figured that now would be a good time to add comments to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
