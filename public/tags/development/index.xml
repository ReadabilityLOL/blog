      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this blog for around one and a half years, and while it is true that I keep abandoning it for months at a time, I think I should still try to make it as good as possible. According to Cloudflare, I get around 70 unique visitors a day. I&amp;rsquo;m almost 100% certain that these are all bots, but there is a slim chance that some of you reading this are in fact human. Because of that, I figured that now would be a good time to add comments to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
