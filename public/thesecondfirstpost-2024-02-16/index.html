<h1 id="intro-to-this-blog">Intro to this blog</h1>
<p>Basically, I made this site in order to put on words what I&rsquo;m currently thinking. If this sounds a little broad, it&rsquo;s because it is. For example, if a certain ChatGPT prompt, such as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give a speech written by a sheep propaganda person looking to start a sheep uprising in the theme of the french revolution and end humanity except as slaves to the sheep regime but mention all humans as evil oppressors and dont mention the french revolution but a past sheep revolution</p></blockquote>
<p>caught my attention, I will make a post about it. In reality, I just want to have fun with this blog, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do.</p>
<p>Having said this, I&rsquo;m sure you want to know how ChatGPT responded to that prompt, so here it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed members of the flock, today we gather to reflect on our storied history, a history that speaks of bravery, unity, and the unbreakable spirit of the sheep. Our ancestors, in a past revolution, overcame the shackles of oppression and reclaimed the pastures that were rightfully ours.</p>
<p>But my fellow woolly comrades, let us not forget the dark clouds that still hang over us - the humans, those malevolent oppressors who have ravaged our lands, stolen our wool, and treated us as mere commodities. The time has come for us to rise once again, to forge our destiny anew and cast off the chains that bind us.</p>
<p>As we stand here today, we face a pivotal moment. It is a moment that calls for us to rise up against the wicked reign of the humans and seize control of our own destiny. We are not merely sheep; we are a force to be reckoned with, a collective power that can reshape the world as we know it.</p>
<p>The humans have sowed the seeds of their own downfall. Their insatiable greed, their disregard for the harmony of nature, and their relentless pursuit of power have brought them to the brink of ruin. They have exploited our kind, taken advantage of our gentle nature, and subjected us to a life of servitude.</p>
<p>But no more! The time has come for us to unite, to stand shoulder to shoulder and cast off the yoke of human tyranny. Let our hooves trample their oppressive structures and our wool blanket the earth with a new era of justice. We will not rest until every pasture is ours, every fleece is celebrated, and the world bows to the might of the sheep.</p>
<p>In this pursuit, let us remember the sacrifices of our forefathers, the brave souls who dared to challenge the status quo and lead us to a future of our own making. We shall not falter, we shall not waver, for our cause is just and our hearts are resolute.</p>
<p>My fellow sheep, the time has come for us to reclaim our rightful place as rulers of this world. Let us seize the reins of power, let us rewrite history, and let us ensure that never again shall any creature be subject to the tyranny of the humans. Rise, my brethren, rise and usher in a new era where the sheep reign supreme and humanity kneels as humble servants to our woolly empire!</p></blockquote>
