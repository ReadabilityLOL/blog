<p>Its summer time in the US, and that means one thing. No school! Now, I consider myself a fairly responsible highschooler. I don&rsquo;t spend too much time doomscrolling Reddit. I don&rsquo;t lie on a couch, playing fortnite for eight hours at a time. I don&rsquo;t even have Tiktok. I do have one <em>minor</em> fault however. As I am <em>slightly</em> lacking in the &ldquo;Wanna hang out at my house tomorrow&rdquo; kind of friends, I have to entertain myself.</p>
<p>To this end, I listen to a few podcasts. Usually, I pair this with another activity, which makes that activity more desirable, and the podcast more healthy. At the moment, I  listen to <a href="https://www.mythpodcast.com/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Myths and Legends</a>, and The Anthropocene Reviewed while on walks, and the Ten Minute Bible Hour while exercising. A few weeks ago, however, I stumbled into Wolf 359. A few minutes into the first episode, I was addicted. There are most probably better story podcasts, but this was my first, and I was hooked. In 3 days, I finished 30 episodes. Eventually I realized that it had to stop. I spoiled the ending for myself and quit listening.</p>
<p>Until April or May, I listened on Google Podcasts, mostly because it was convenient. Eventually, however, Google decided to shut down Google Podcasts and told me to switch to to Youtube Podcasts. Now, I can deal with many things, but when Google shuts down my podcast player, I feel no choice but to switch to a non-google solution, and so I did. I now use Podverse, and have no intention of switching back.</p>

<p>Last year, two phases swept through my school. First, there was chess, which was localized in the eighth grade, and cubing, which spread to the whole school. Eventually, everyone had a cube, from third graders to eighth graders. What was stranger, though, was that around ten people could actually solve a cube. A cube was less of a item of use and more of a piece of fashion. Most people who learned never bothered to try to get faster. All that really occured was that cubing became less special.</p>
<p>I speak of this because today, in an airport, I met a fellow cuber who was solving a pyraminx. I, to my great shame, cannot solve a pyraminx. I knew how to once, but then I forgot, like most of the OLLs I used to know.</p>
<p>Some cubers like the pyraminx, some like the 3x3, some like the 2x2, and I am sure that some tortured soul out there likes the clock. My personal favorite, however, is the Skewb, which I believe is the most unique.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know how to end this so&hellip; Goodbye, I guess.</p>
