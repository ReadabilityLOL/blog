    Link to heading
  

I&rsquo;ve had this blog for around one and a half years, and while it is true that I keep abandoning it for months at a time, I think I should still try to make it as good as possible. According to Cloudflare, I get around 70 unique visitors a day. I&rsquo;m almost 100% certain that these are all bots, but there is a slim chance that some of you reading this are in fact human. Because of that, I figured that now would be a good time to add comments to my blog.">

<p>I&rsquo;ve had this blog for around one and a half years, and while it is true that I keep abandoning it for months at a time, I think I should still try to make it as good as possible.

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>I had, in the end, basically one constraint for whatever software I used to make comments. I wanted my commenting solution to be free. I also wanted it to be more private, but I was willing to sacrifice my integrity for the sake of my money<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I looked at a few options for adding comments to my blog:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commento</li>
</ol>
<p>This one looked pretty nice, but then I realized that it didn&rsquo;t have a free tier. I&rsquo;m completely fine with the <em>idea</em> that people pay for services online, but I&rsquo;ve never really caught on to the idea of <em>me</em> paying for services online. As such, I ruled this one out.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Disqus</li>
</ol>
<p>To be completely honest, I didn&rsquo;t really look too much at this one. I heard that it had some privacy issues and figured I could find something better</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Giscus</li>
</ol>
<p>After seeing this one, I immediately decided it was the best option for me. It was relatively easy<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> to implement, and seems to work. I just pasted it in to the template for it in the theme I&rsquo;m using, and it worked, which was nice. I had some issues with styling it, but that was all my own fault<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
