Dear Mr. Smith</p>
<p>We have been informed about some of your concerns regarding the safety of our food. I would like to inform you that we strive to make our food digestible by the vast majority of those who consume it and agree that public safety should be a priority in any company. In this letter, I hope to address all of your points about our food safety and edibility.</p>
<p>Concerning the portion of your letter which states, &ldquo;There was a rat in my spaghetti&rdquo;, I would like to state that the rat is in fact a quality tester at our restaurant whose presence is necessary for the healthy running of the restaurant.</p>
<p>Your letter then says, &ldquo;The rat next chewed my leg, which later became infected&rdquo;. We, as a restaurant and as a respectable organization, do not have any specimens of <em>Rattus Rattus</em> in our restaurant and believe that you must be mistaken.</p>
<p>Concerning your statement that &ldquo;twelve cockroaches entered my shoes immediately after I sat down&rdquo;, we would like to state that, as we have no cockroaches in the establishment, they must have been brought in by you.</p>
<p>Finally, concerning your allegations about our &ldquo;numerous health violations&rdquo;, we would like to remind you that said allegations are libel and if you cease to desist we will be forced to sue you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><code> </code><br>
