      <description>Fortune Cookies I went to a Chinese restaurant yesterday, and got a fortune cookie that actually contained a fortune. This cookie didn&amp;rsquo;t have any of that &amp;ldquo;Smile, and you will be happier&amp;rdquo; fortunes. This thing was a real fortune. It said &amp;ldquo;The next meal you eat will be your best&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Later that day, I went to a mexican restaurant, which may not even have qualified for my 500th best meal.</description>

      <description>Podcasts Its summer time in the US, and that means one thing. No school! Now, I consider myself a fairly responsible highschooler. I don&amp;rsquo;t spend too much time doomscrolling Reddit. I don&amp;rsquo;t lie on a couch, playing fortnite for eight hours at a time. I don&amp;rsquo;t even have Tiktok. I do have one minor fault however. As I am slightly lacking in the &amp;ldquo;Wanna hang out at my house tomorrow&amp;rdquo; kind of friends, I have to entertain myself.</description>

      <title>The time travel problem</title>

      <description>Introduction This post, despite its name, is not about the feasibility of time travel. This post is, rather, about a common theory dealing with time travel paradoxes. People often claim that if someone time travelled to kill Hitler, for example, his parent would adopt, or someone else would come to power, and kill the six million people in an equivalent scenario. I believe that this frankly isn&amp;rsquo;t true. Brief Disclaimer: This is my opinion.</description>

      <title>Analysis and results of the second sheep war</title>

      <description>Tensions rise After the first human-sheep war, tensions seemed to die down between the two species. By the year 2053, trade began between the sheep and the humans. The moose had control of Canada and the northern U.S, the emus controlled australia, and the sheep had what remained of what was agreed on by the sixth treaty of Paris. As trade emerged, humans began to see sheep as potential allies instead of threats, as shown by the rising popularity of vegetarianism.</description>

      <description>Events leading to the beginning of the war The first human-sheep war began on August 31, 2032. Humanity, who had enslaved the sheep for thousands of years, had grown complacent, and was not aware of the threat posed by the sheep, considering them to be stupid animals. Unbeknownst to them, the sheep had gathered under the leadership of an unknown sheep. By the year 2030, the sheep revolution had grown, and weapons had been stockpiled, as well as an armada of ships created in the Municipality of Sealand.</description>

      <title>An analysis of third grade culture</title>

      <description>Introduction to the third grader A common misconception regarding the third grader is that this group of people is a mere subclass of the elementary schooler. This, however, is a mistake, as the group known as the third grader is in fact more different from other groups than a subclass could rightly be. This group of people can once again be divided into male and female, each with their distinct characteristics.</description>

      <description>Intro to this blog Basically, I made this site in order to put on words what I&amp;rsquo;m currently thinking. If this sounds a little broad, it&amp;rsquo;s because it is. For example, if a certain ChatGPT prompt, such as&#xA;Give a speech written by a sheep propaganda person looking to start a sheep uprising in the theme of the french revolution and end humanity except as slaves to the sheep regime but mention all humans as evil oppressors and dont mention the french revolution but a past sheep revolution</description>
