  <h1 id="events-leading-to-the-beginning-of-the-war">Events leading to the beginning of the war</h1>
<p>The first human-sheep war began on August 31, 2032. Humanity, who had enslaved the sheep for thousands of years, had grown complacent, and was not aware of the threat posed by the sheep, considering them to be stupid animals. Unbeknownst to them, the sheep had gathered under the leadership of an unknown sheep. By the year 2030, the sheep revolution had grown, and weapons had been stockpiled, as well as an armada of ships created in the Municipality of Sealand. By December 2031, there was enough momentum in the movement that the sheep were able to begin the revolution. They waited for the opportune moment, which came in August, after the second Potato famine, which occured after a scientist named George Smith tampered with viruses that damaged the potato industry. As three-fifth&rsquo;s of the world&rsquo;s human population was in danger, the leaders of the sheep decided it was time to attack. They began attacks in countries with a high sheep to human ratio, such as the Falkland Islands and New Zealand. Both areas collapsed without much resistance, and as they had low geopolitical significance, the collapse of both areas was unnoticed for several month, allowing the sheep to setup a base of operations in New Zealand. The sheep began communication with potential allies, like the moose in Canada, the pigs in Russia, and the Emus in Australia.</p>
<h1 id="the-first-battle-of-canberra">The first battle of Canberra</h1>
<p>On September 10th, 2032, The city of Canberra was attacked in the west by the Emus, who had taken the largely desert western part of Austrailia, and by the east by the sheep, who entered from New Zealand. The sheep breached the Parliament House seven hours later, and Australia fell within five days. The sheep set up a military base and left the emus in charge of Australia. It is important to note that only mainland Australia was captured, as the Tasmanian Devils voted to stay neutral by a narrow margin. At this point, world governments still dismissed the sheep as a minor threat, even though they had already lost an entire continent.</p>
<h1 id="other-sheep-victories">Other sheep victories</h1>
<p>Other sheep victories included the takings of Mongolia, Uruguay, and Wales. The latter one, however, was almost disasterous for the sheep, as this constituted a direct attack on Great Britain, which incited NATO. The governments, however, still believed that all the invasions were independent, so, while they reinvaded Wales, they did not attack the sheep strongholds in New Zealand and Australia. Sealand, which provided a base for the invasion of countries such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Belgium, was also not invaded, though this was because it was overlooked, as it had low geopolitical significance.</p>
<h1 id="the-collapse-of-america">The collapse of America</h1>
<p>At this point, while there was some tension about the sheep threat, the humans still believed that the sheep victories had been a fluke. This all changed, however, on January 31, 2033, when the sheep began the full invasion of America. The moose, who had been promised the northern United States by the sheep, invaded from the Canadian border. The sheep attacked from the inside, as they were already inside the farms of the United States. Since they were mainly located in the central United States, which had a high number of sheep per capita, the sheep easily conquered the central United States, splitting it. At this point, the humans finally realized the threat, but too late. The moose had taken over Idaho, Washington, Minnesota, and Montana. The taking of Idaho threatened the United States&rsquo;s food supply, and they mobilized the army. but too late. At the battle for Wyoming, the sheep and moose took over the last stronghold in the central United States. After meeting with troops in Iowa and Arkansas, the sheep quickly conquered everything except the East and West coasts of the United States. At this point, the sheep had control of a nuclear arsenal and threatened destruction of the world.</p>
<h1 id="the-sixth-treaty-of-paris-and-the-conclusion-of-the-war">The sixth treaty of Paris and the conclusion of the war</h1>
<p>As the sheep threatened the entire modern world, the western world had forgone their typical strategy of not negotiating with terrorists and negotiated with the sheep. As mutually assured destruction was imminent, the ambassadors agreed to give the sheep the Americas and Australia. This appeased everyone except the pigs, who felt wronged, as they did not recieve any land even though they supported the sheep. This was in fact one of the motivations for the second war of the humans and sheep.</p>
