# Who am I?
I'm Josh, a high schooler who decided last year to start a blog. I'm interested in technology, old games, and books. When I'm not wasting my time mindlessly doomscrolling on Reddit, I'm usually reading a book or trying to teach myself something, like [how to make a blog](/) or [how to 3d model in Freecad](https://github.com/readabilityLOL/wallet). I like making things, and I intend this blog to be both a log of things I make and a way to get more practice writing. You never know, it might even help me on a j*b applicat**n one day.
