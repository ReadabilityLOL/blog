## The website
I'm going to try to update this site around once every two weeks. If I don't, just send me an angry email or something, and I'll be sure to disregard it completely.

## What I'm reading/listening to
I just finished listening to Penguin Audio's adaptation of [Reaper Man](https://bookwyrm.social/book/21745/s/reaper-man) by Terry Pratchett. I really love Penguin's adaptations of discworld and this book was no different. I'm also currently reading [The Tipping Point](https://bookwyrm.social/book/154/s/the-tipping-point) by Malcolm Gladwell for a summer assignment and [Rise and Kill First](https://bookwyrm.social/book/269459/s/rise-and-kill-first-the-secret-history-of-israels-targeted-assassinations) by Ronen Bergman because I saw a Reddit comment talking about it and figured it sounded interesting.

## What I'm watching
A friend recently coerced me into watching the Star Wars original and prequel trilogies with him, which means I can now cross those off my list of things to do.
I'm also planning to start watching my Cosmos DVDs soon.

## What I'm working on right now
I'm currently working on a few projects right now. First off, I'm working on a text editor for Windows XP. My first log for that should be out soon. I'm also working on creating a website for a friend, which may have been a bad decision on his part, given my history with website design. 

I'm also currently taking Health over the summer at my school, since I figured it would take up unnecessary time during the school year. I don't really regret the decision, even though it takes up 2 hours each day, because I wasn't doing anything with those hours anyway.

I also signed myself up to be a DM at my school's DnD club next year, and I haven't started preparing yet. I should really start that soon.

I'm trying to exercise a bit more, since that's always healthy, and I'll try to update that here later.

Finally, I'm working on the Genelab for High Schooler's capstone project with a group, which is taking up a good bit of my time.

## What I'm learning
Over the summer, I've been learning a few things using online resources, and I'm going to try to ramp them up to prepare for the upcoming school year. I started working on the [Haskell course at mooc.fi](https://haskell.mooc.fi), and I've been doing a few sections every other day for the past month or so. 

I'm also preparing for my high school Calculus and Physics classses with the help of [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org), though I haven't really been doing these very much. I'm going to start trying to work on these for an hour each day. 

I've also been practicing German a bit, using [Clozemaster](https://clozemaster.com), and [Anki](https://ankiweb.net), though I should probably work on these a bit more intensely as school approaches. I'm also preparing for the SAT, because I'm taking it for the first time in November. I've already started doing Collegeboard's [SAT Question of the Day](https://qotd.collegeboard.org), but I feel that I can do a bit more, and I'll probably start doing Khan Academy's SAT prep course.

Finally, I'm also learning a bit of [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), since that's a pretty cool subject. I'm currently using William Spaniel's excellent [Game Theory 101](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKI1h_nAkaQoDzI4xDIXzx6U2ergFmedo) course, and taking notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
