# Problem Solving steps in Physics

## 1. Read the problem carefully
- Don't get tripped up and miss a value or what you're trying to solve

## 2. Draw a diagram of the problem
- This helps you visualize the problem (duh)
- Makes you less likely to mess up

## 3. Write down all given information
- You need to know what you have in order to solve the problem

## 4. Find what equation you need
- Look it up in the reference table

## 5. Substitute in values
- Pretty self explanatory, imo

## 6. Solve the equation
- What are you waiting for? Just solve it.
