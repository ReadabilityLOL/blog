# Everything's an argument chapter 4
## Intro
- Logos is the portion of arguments based on:
	- Facts
	- Evidence
	- Reason
- It's not always based on hard evidence
	- Reasoning, etc

## Providing Hard Evidence
- People like evidence more than reasoning
	- Pictures of missile tests
	- "smoking gun"
	- data
- Helps back up claims
	- Some caveats:
		- Make sure evidence is reliable
		- Watch for how topics are framed
		- Remember that bad evidence often gets circulated
			- Antivax
			- "Obama is a Muslim"
			- Flat Earth
### Using Statistics
- "Figures lie and liars figure"
- Numbers have to be interpreted
	- Crime rate fell by 10%!
	- Crime rate only fell by 10%
#### Surveys/Polls
- Biggest type of statistics used
- Very persuasive
	- 72% of Americans support it
- Always scrutinize these:
	- Who commissioned the poll?
	- Who was surveyed?
	- When was the poll made?
### Testimonies and narratives
- Use testimonies to support claims
- I feel like this strays into the land of pathos, but whatever I guess.

## Reason and Common sense
- Sometimes, you don't have hard evidence
- Use logic to draw conclusions
- Includes syllogisms:
	> All human beings are mortal
	> 
	> Socrates is a human being
	> 
	> Therefore, Socrates is mortal
	- I like these, but they're not always necessary
	- Normal logic works well enough usually
- Usually, though, we use enthymemes
	- These are statements that use shared assumptions
		- "We have to cancel the picnic because it's going to rain"
			- Assumption that rain is bad, etc.
### Cultural Assumptions and values
- Arguments can be based on shared values
	- Arguments based on equality, fairness
	- More enthymemes
	- Writers must understand values held by their audiences

## Providing Logical Structures for Argument
- Arguments can be based on particular logical structures
### Degree
- If X is bad, then Y is worse
- If X gets this, then Y should get this
- If Toyotas get a 10 year warranty, then Porsches should get an even longer one

### Analogies
- Compare things
	- Very intuitive
- X is like Y
- This new bill is basically slavery
- Commonly abused tactic

### Precedent
- Also use comparisons, but differently
- X happened in the past, Y can happen now
- People in X do Z, why can't people in Y do Z?
- Used in court cases
