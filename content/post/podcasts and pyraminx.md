# Podcasts

Its summer time in the US, and that means one thing. No school! Now, I consider myself a fairly responsible highschooler. I don't spend too much time doomscrolling Reddit. I don't lie on a couch, playing fortnite for eight hours at a time. I don't even have Tiktok. I do have one *minor* fault however. As I am *slightly* lacking in the "Wanna hang out at my house tomorrow" kind of friends, I have to entertain myself. 

To this end, I listen to a few podcasts. Usually, I pair this with another activity, which makes that activity more desirable, and the podcast more healthy. At the moment, I  listen to [Myths and Legends](https://www.mythpodcast.com/), and The Anthropocene Reviewed while on walks, and the Ten Minute Bible Hour while exercising. A few weeks ago, however, I stumbled into Wolf 359. A few minutes into the first episode, I was addicted. There are most probably better story podcasts, but this was my first, and I was hooked. In 3 days, I finished 30 episodes. Eventually I realized that it had to stop. I spoiled the ending for myself and quit listening. 

Until April or May, I listened on Google Podcasts, mostly because it was convenient. Eventually, however, Google decided to shut down Google Podcasts and told me to switch to to Youtube Podcasts. Now, I can deal with many things, but when Google shuts down my podcast player, I feel no choice but to switch to a non-google solution, and so I did. I now use Podverse, and have no intention of switching back.

# Pyraminx

Last year, two phases swept through my school. First, there was chess, which was localized in the eighth grade, and cubing, which spread to the whole school. Eventually, everyone had a cube, from third graders to eighth graders. What was stranger, though, was that around ten people could actually solve a cube. A cube was less of a item of use and more of a piece of fashion. Most people who learned never bothered to try to get faster. All that really occured was that cubing became less special. 

I speak of this because today, in an airport, I met a fellow cuber who was solving a pyraminx. I, to my great shame, cannot solve a pyraminx. I knew how to once, but then I forgot, like most of the OLLs I used to know. 

Some cubers like the pyraminx, some like the 3x3, some like the 2x2, and I am sure that some tortured soul out there likes the clock. My personal favorite, however, is the Skewb, which I believe is the most unique. 

I don't really know how to end this so... Goodbye, I guess.
