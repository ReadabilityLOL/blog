> **_NOTE:_**  This post is not a tutorial on how to make a notes app for windows xp. I will try to document my progress as I go along, but its important to note that I may skip steps if I feel they are trivial, and while my code will be put on Github, I might not always state the exact logic behind specific sections of it.
