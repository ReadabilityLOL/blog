# Episode 1 

or

# Why the heck am I making a blog, this is such a stupid idea, like what if colleges or future recruiters look at this and I look like an idiot? 

Dear reader, if you ever read this, you may ask yourself, "What am I doing here? Why am I reading the failed blog of a highschooler?[^1] He can't even gain a single star on Github. He can't even figure out how to build anything without Stack Overflow. Why am I here? This is stupid. "

I respond to this: You are absolutely right. I barely know anything about code or keeping myself motivated or anything. Those things are, however, the **very reason** I am making this blog. To keep a habit, to paraphrase somewhere from Atomic Habits[^2] , you need accountability. The threat of public humilliation, however small the chance, is a great way to make yourself do something. You see, I don't believe that my subconscious realizes how negligible the chances of someone reading this is, so it will probably force me to keep habits. Also, I want to grow my writing (typing) skills. I need to do more writing, and a blog seems like a good place to practice.

Now, there are a few things that I want this blog to help me with:

1. The [Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). I started learning their Ruby path, but haven't done it in a while.

2. Doing my homework. I usually get it done, but I often delay so that I have to quickly do it, and again, semi-public humiliation could help. The same applies to other things, like practicing piano and studying for a bible quizzing league I am in.

3. Sticking with things. I find that, without something to help me, I often stop doing things, like the aforementioned Odin Project. This can, hopefully, help.
