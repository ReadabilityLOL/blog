## Intro
I've wanted to make a hugo theme for some time now, because I like making things and figured that this would be a good project. I'm going to try to model this theme after the one at [dimden.dev](https://dimden.dev/), because I think it looks really cool, and I like things that look really cool.

## Begin development

The first step to make our Hugo theme is to create a new theme, of course.
```
hugo new theme retro
```
I'm calling this theme retro for now, because I can't think of anything else
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "started project"
```
Probably should use git for this.


Now, I'm not exactly sure how we're supposed to start a theme, so I'm just going to start off by changing the background color in main.css to black and changing the font to white Share Tech Mono so the theme looks more tech-y
```

```
