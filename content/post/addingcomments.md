# Intro

I've had this blog for around one and a half years, and while it is true that I keep abandoning it for months at a time, I think I should still try to make it as good as possible. According to Cloudflare, I get around 70 unique visitors a day. I'm almost 100% certain that these are all bots, but there is a slim chance that some of you reading this are in fact human. Because of that, I figured that now would be a good time to add comments to my blog.

# Finding commenting solutions

I had, in the end, basically one constraint for whatever software I used to make comments. I wanted my commenting solution to be free. I also wanted it to be more private, but I was willing to sacrifice my integrity for the sake of my money[^1]. 

I looked at a few options for adding comments to my blog:

1. Commento

This one looked pretty nice, but then I realized that it didn't have a free tier. I'm completely fine with the *idea* that people pay for services online, but I've never really caught on to the idea of *me* paying for services online. As such, I ruled this one out.

2. Disqus

To be completely honest, I didn't really look too much at this one. I heard that it had some privacy issues and figured I could find something better

3. Giscus

After seeing this one, I immediately decided it was the best option for me. It was relatively easy[^2] to implement, and seems to work. I just pasted it in to the template for it in the theme I'm using, and it worked, which was nice. I had some issues with styling it, but that was all my own fault[^3].
