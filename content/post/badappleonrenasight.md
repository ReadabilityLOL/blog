## Intro
I recently got this device from Renasight, which appears to be some kidney screening service or something. I wasn't really interested in the product, my kidneys are fine, thank you very much, but the device itself is pretty interesting. It's basically just an mp4 player wrapped in advertisements, and I wanted to see how easy it was to say, change the video inside to a different mp4. It turned out to be disappointingly easy. The device had a USB-C port on it, and I just plugged it into my computer and added the mp4 files I wanted.

My only real problem was that the thing only has ~200 megabytes of storage, so I can't put too much on it. I did manage, though, to put a rather low resolution Monty Python and the Holy Grail on it, though.
