## Begin anecdote

I attempted to make a schedule today, which I felt very proud about. I started off by working on some SAT prep, then I did my social studies homework, and even started a physics assignment. That was the point at which everything derailed. 

I randomly found about about [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://hpmor.com), which is basically a Harry Potter fanfic except that he's raised by a scientist instead. I haven't even read Harry Potter, and I loved it, which was problematic due to the fact that I was planning on being productive today. I read like 39 chapters of it today, and, in my defense, also worked on some more homework, but with *significantly* less efficiency and quality than normal.
