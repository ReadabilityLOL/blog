# Introduction to the third grader

A common misconception regarding the third grader is that this group of people is a mere subclass of the elementary schooler. This, however, is a mistake, as the group known as the third grader is in fact more different from other groups than a subclass could rightly be. This group of people can once again be divided into male and female, each with their distinct characteristics. The male and female groups, while often existing in the same locations, tend to keep apart from each other and often scorn those who make contact with the other group. Due to these divisions, this article will be adressing the male portion of the class known as third-graders, as they are different enough to merit different articles about each.

# A brief analysis of language

The third grader speaks a different dialect than other classes in the ecosystem. For example, while a younger second grader might laugh at a knock knock joke, the third grader will interpret such language as boring, or something to scoff at. The third grader will only laugh at something bathroom related, like "fart", or "poop". 

A table is shown, presenting the difference in different classes.

|Example       |second-grader|third-grader|fourth-grader  |
|--------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
|Joke          |"Knock Knock"|"Poopyhead" |\<inside joke\>|
|Return comment|"Who's there?"       |"No, you're a poopyhead"|\<traditional reply to inside joke\>|
|Greeting|"Hi!"|"Hi, fartface"|"Hi!"|
|Farewell remark|"Bye!"|"Bye, fartypoop"|"See you!"|

As you can see, the dialect spoken by the class known as third graders is quite different from other areas.

# An observation of culture

## Social Hierarchy

The third grader's social heirarchy has several subclasses. 

At the top of the pyramid is the 'cool people'. These people may have derived this coolness from athletic activity, highly honored by this group, ability to do 'forbidden things', such as watching movies over PG, or often mentioning synonyms to fecal matter. These people have high ranking, and are highly respected by others. People in this class often do not do their homework, or fail tests.

Next in the rankings are those who are slightly above average in things. These people are unable to advance due to reasons such as being overshadowed by more athletic people, overdoing the common jokes near them, or having spoken to a member of the other gender. People in this rank often do okay on homework and tests, but below average. These people often follow the top class around.

Next is the middle class. Members of this area usually are passable in athletic activity, but are shadowed by others who 'never pass to them' or 'are ball-hogs'. These people, while having less adoration for the top class, still respect them and would most likely obey one of a higher class' commands. These people most likely recieve average grades.

After this is the so-called 'smart people'. These people are most likely subpar in athletic performance, but most likely recieve higher grades than most.
