## Intro
Recently, I tried to start adding my notes to this site so I could access them easier and maybe to inspire me to take better notes. I tried to use Obsidian to do so and then link it to hugo, but it turned out to be too tedious. Because of this, I have decided to switch to using [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum) to store my notes and keep the notes at [notes.glitched.tech]("https://notes.glitched.tech").
