## Intro

Recently, I recieved an old Windows XP machine. I was pretty excited to use it, but I will admit that it sat around in my garage for a week or two before I brought it inside. I wasn't too sure what I could do with an old machine like that, but I figured I could have some fun with it. I decided that, if nothing else, I could at least play some games on it.

## But can it play DOOM?

Yes. As connecting to the internet would probably be a particularly foolhardy move (even for me), I decided to copy the .iso files from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/doom-play) onto a usb and then connect them to the XP computer. This worked surpisingly well, and I played through the first few levels before deciding to install some more software. I was a bit annoyed, though, because there didn't appear to be any music. I think it was due to some hardware issues. 

## We rip a few DVDs 

Since my computer does have a DVD-ROM port, I figured it would be interesting to watch a few old DVDs I had lying around. I picked up [Cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage) from a garage sale last year, so I figured I should start watching it at some point. I installed [DVD Decrypter](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/12-dvd-decrypter.html) and [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) and ripped the first disk. Unfortunately, I had issues with the second disk, but I'll figure it out sometime or another.

## Halo and Half Life

I went back onto the internet archive, and I installed a lot more pieces of software and games. In particular, I grabbed Morrowind, Half Life 1, and Halo. I also installed old versions of Autodesk Animator, Inventor, and Autocad, and Microsoft Paint. I keep looking through the archive and installing random programs I find interesting, so it's likely I'll update this later with other random things I find. I'm not too worried that I'll get a virus, because I figure that I can always just reinstall windows again.
