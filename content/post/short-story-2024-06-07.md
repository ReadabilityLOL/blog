The man walked down the road, lost in a cloud of boredom and indifference. The world seemed so hopeless, so lonely. He stood in a crowd of people, all smiling. How could they stand it? How could they bear to smile when the world was so hopeless, so sad, so broken? He wanted to scream to them, to tell them how meaningless, how useless it all was. To tell them to stop, to stop being so happy, to realize how futile it all was. Then he stopped. He took off his glasses, wiped them, put them on again, and smiled.
