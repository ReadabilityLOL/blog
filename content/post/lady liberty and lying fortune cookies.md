# Fortune Cookies

I went to a Chinese restaurant yesterday, and got a fortune cookie that actually contained a fortune. This cookie didn't have any of that "Smile, and you will be happier" fortunes. This thing was a real fortune. It said "The next meal you eat will be your best".

Later that day, I went to a mexican restaurant, which may not even have qualified for my 500th best meal.
