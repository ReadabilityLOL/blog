## Intro
After a few months having comments on this site, I have now decided to remove them. This is because my github account was temporarily suspended, probably because I kept reloading comments and having giscus load over and over. This broke a lot of stuff, including cloudflare, which couldn't connect to my github repo. Because of this, I have removed comment from my site until I find a new solution or can guarantee that I won't manage to do this again sometime.
