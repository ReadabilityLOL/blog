## In which I make a mistake

I'm currently taking AP Lang at my school, a class which typically involves writing rhetorical analyses of nonfiction text and constructing arguments. My teacher, however, has figured that the actual curriculum given by College Board is a bit light for a class taking up a whole year. As such, she also assigned us an inquiry project, which is a completely self-guided project that each of us has to undertake. The good thing about it was that we could do anything we wanted for it. The bad thing about it was that we could do anything we wanted for it.

I decided, for my project, that I would design and create a first person shooter game. I figured that with careful time management, this should be a relatively simple task. Unfortunately, I seem to have left my careful time management in another pocket. As such, I haven't really got much done for the first two months, which means that I have around three more months left to get this project done. While this should be *plenty* of time to make a minimal first person shooter game, I want to be careful about this and have some sort of accountability. As such, I will now be documenting my progress here.

## My current progress

I found a tutorial on how to make a first person shooter [here](https://gameidea.org/2025/09/07/building-an-fps-from-scratch-in-godot-fps-series/), and I've been following it a bit. Currently, I'm on the third step, though I still need to make sprites for the player and for the weapon. That will be what I do for my next post, which will hopefully be tomorrow.
