## Abstract

A common question raised, often as either an icebreaker or as a serious matter of contention, is whether or not cereal is a soup. Despite the seemingly simple nature of the question, the answer to whether cereal is a soup is a multifaceted conundrum with real-world implications. In this article, I hope to clarify the various arguments in this field and state my own opinion on the matter.

## Introduction

To begin, we must first clearly define the terminology of this field. Cereal, in this article, is defined as a heterogenous substance consisting mostly of a grain-based solid[^1] submerged in a milk-like liquid[^2]. For the sake of conciseness, the specificities defining grains and milk-like liquids are beyond the scope of this project. A soup is commonly defined as a heterogenous or homogenous substance consisting mostly of a liquid[^3], sometimes with solids[^4] contained inside. Along with this, a common extension of the definition of a soup relies on common sense with what is and is not considered a soup. While the previous definition of a soup is often considered complete, the author of this article holds different claims about the definition of a soup that will be revealed later.
