# Events leading to the beginning of the war

The first human-sheep war began on August 31, 2032. Humanity, who had enslaved the sheep for thousands of years, had grown complacent, and was not aware of the threat posed by the sheep, considering them to be stupid animals. Unbeknownst to them, the sheep had gathered under the leadership of an unknown sheep. By the year 2030, the sheep revolution had grown, and weapons had been stockpiled, as well as an armada of ships created in the Municipality of Sealand. By December 2031, there was enough momentum in the movement that the sheep were able to begin the revolution. They waited for the opportune moment, which came in August, after the second Potato famine, which occured after a scientist named George Smith tampered with viruses that damaged the potato industry. As three-fifth's of the world's human population was in danger, the leaders of the sheep decided it was time to attack. They began attacks in countries with a high sheep to human ratio, such as the Falkland Islands and New Zealand. Both areas collapsed without much resistance, and as they had low geopolitical significance, the collapse of both areas was unnoticed for several month, allowing the sheep to setup a base of operations in New Zealand. The sheep began communication with potential allies, like the moose in Canada, the pigs in Russia, and the Emus in Australia. 

# The first battle of Canberra

On September 10th, 2032, The city of Canberra was attacked in the west by the Emus, who had taken the largely desert western part of Austrailia, and by the east by the sheep, who entered from New Zealand. The sheep breached the Parliament House seven hours later, and Australia fell within five days. The sheep set up a military base and left the emus in charge of Australia. It is important to note that only mainland Australia was captured, as the Tasmanian Devils voted to stay neutral by a narrow margin. At this point, world governments still dismissed the sheep as a minor threat, even though they had already lost an entire continent.

# The battle for Idaho 

The moose of Canada, who already had virtual control of the country, even before the war, crossed the American border at Idaho. The sheep planned to cripple the world's food supply by destroying the potatoes in Idaho, which over half of the world depended on for sustenance. They were only partially successful, however, because at this point, there were already military officials located there, intent on solving the potatoes' disease created by George Smith. They managed to get the word out to the U.S. government, and reinforements were sent. The moose captured the territory up to Payette national forest, but were forced by the government back to the Nez Perce reservation. This became known as the battle of Idaho, which both sides considered a win. The Americans believed they had stopped the advance, and the animals had gained a valuable area for potato farming, which they could use to feed their army.
