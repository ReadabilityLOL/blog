## Intro

Now, I have never made a post like this, and I don't feel I'm qualified to do this, but here goes. When making the [theme](https://github.com/readabilitylol/terminus) for this blog, I wanted to add some custom fonts. After some googling, I found that it was ridiculously easy to do, but I want to write a post, so, why not?

## Adding fonts

There are two ways to do this. The first (The one I used ), is to download the font online and enter the file path.

For example:

```css
@font-face { font-family: firacode; src: url('/fonts/FiraCode-Regular.ttf'); }
```

The second way is to load it from a website online. This is similar to the other way, except the file path is a URL. 

For example:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Code:wght@300..700&family=Teko:wght@300..700&display=swap')

```
