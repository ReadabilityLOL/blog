## About

 Terminus is a terminal theme for Hugo. I built it for [my own site](https://blog.glitched.tech), but you can use it for your site If you want to. I built this in my spare time to teach myself, so if anything is broken, don't hesitate to tell me or fix it and give me a pull request.

## Install

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/readabilityLOL/terminus.git
```
