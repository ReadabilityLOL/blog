## About

 Terminus is a terminal theme for Hugo. I built it for [my own site](https://blog.glitched.tech), but you can use it for your site If you want to. I built this in my spare time to teach myself, so if anything is broken, don't hesitate to tell me or fix it and give me a pull request. 

## Install

1. Enter your themes directory

2. Run this command 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/readabilityLOL/terminus.git themes/terminus
    ```
