## About

 Terminus is a terminal theme for Hugo. I built it for [my own site](https://blog.glitched.tech), but you can use it for your site If you want to. I built this in my spare time to teach myself, so if anything is broken, don't hesitate to tell me.

## Install

```bash
go get -u -v github.com/spf13/hugo
```
